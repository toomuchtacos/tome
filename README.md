# Tome
A browser based command line utility / reader app.

- [Read the introductory blog post](http://thorpe-poynter.com/post/tome/).
- [Try the example app](http://tome.thorpe-poynter.com/).

## Tome is still in it's infancy!
You can [preview an example application here](http://tome.thorpe-poynter.com/). As of now, this repository only holds modules which demonstrate client-side command registration, command parsing and the creation of a basic terminal interface.

### What to expect:
The above [example app](http://tome.thorpe-poynter.com/) runs on a Node.js / Express server which handles parsing markdown into HTML and responding to the various commands issued through the terminal. I'll soon be committing an example directory which contains what you'll need to get your own server going.
